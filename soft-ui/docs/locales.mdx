<Tip>
  This is used to edit any of the text in the theme. You can also add your own
  locales to the theme to support multiple languages.
</Tip>

<Info>
  The **top most** locale will be the default locale will be used when no locale
  is detected from the browser. By not defining `themeConfig.locales` the themes
  premade locale will be used.
