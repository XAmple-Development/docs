Discord-Dashboard is a module that allows you to create a simple Dashboard for the Discord Bot using Node.js. The module has the entire API system integrated and only requires the user to configure the necessary options. He doesn't have to write the whole API from scratch. We also allow you to choose a Theme that you can change at any time when using the module without worrying about changing the system.

We welcome your interest in the project!
