title: "Required Permissions"
description: "You can restrict the availability of the Dashboard to only users with reassurance data on the server."

It must be an Array of [DISCORD_FLAGS.Permissions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions#permissions-bitwise-permission-flags) that you want to require users to have in order to allow them to use the Dashboard.

Discord-Dashboard allows to use multiple permissions required.

## Example Usage

```js
new DBD.Dashboard({
  requiredPermissions: [
    DBD.DISCORD_FLAGS.Permissions.MANAGE_GUILD,
    DBD.DISCORD_FLAGS.Permissions.BAN_MEMBERS,
  ],
});
```
