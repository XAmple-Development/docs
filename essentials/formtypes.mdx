## What are Form Types?

If you want to create the ability to change the prefix for the user, you would use a text input with a character limit of 4, right? With Discord-Dashboard this is trivially easy because you just need to choose the right input type and give it settings like minimum and maximum character length, which is also trivially easy. And thatâ€™s what FormTypes are.

## What Form Types are available?

We offer over 10 Form Types for you to use depending on your needs. Please note that due to the way things have grown, there are some Form Types that are included in the core Discord Dashboard and some that are only available for each theme.
